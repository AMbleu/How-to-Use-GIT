This is a basic GitHub Tutorial
------------------------------------------------------
Instructions

-Follow the numbered instructions step by step to make your first Commit
-try to type as many of the commands as possible instead of simply copy and pasting, practice makes perfect
-Lines with ** and anything following them are extra credit and you don't need to follow them
  they are meant to teach you some basic terminal commands

------------------------------------------------------
1.Create a GitHub Account
  Go to github.com and create your account

------------------------------------------------------
2.Install git on your computer:
  Windows/Linux/MacOS go to https://git-scm.com/downloads
    -If link does not work type git into search engine and click on the git-scm.com link and go to downloads
    -Follow the download instructions and get to git installed and the git-bash application as well where you can enter the command line Commands

------------------------------------------------------
3.Create a folder/Directory where you can store your git repositories
  -I suggest calling it GitRepos

**Create the folder/directory usinf Terminal
  Open the bash terminal or your systems command prompt/Terminal type the following
  cd                  -Using this command by itself changes current directory to your default user directory
  ls -l               -Shows you all the items in your current Directory the -l option list them neatly
  mkdir GitReops      -Makes the GitReops folder/directory in that directory
  ls -l               -Compare this list to the previous one your GitRepos folder/directory should be here now
  cd ./GitRepos       -moves you into the folder/directory you just created
  pwd                 -prints out what directory your in it should have a path and end with /GitRepos

------------------------------------------------------
4.Getting the Repository from GitHub
  Now go to your command terminal if not already in it.
    -in terminal or bash navigate to the directory where your Git repositories are going to be stored using the cd command
    -if you followed the extra credit portion above you should already be in that directory

  Type the following into the terminal to get the a repository:
    git clone https://github.com/AMbleu/How-to-Use-GIT.git                -this git clone command is how you download git repositories to edit or simply have a copy

------------------------------------------------------
5.Setting up your identity in git to make edits
  When making changes(commits) you need to have a username and email so git knows who made the changes and to tell git who you are do the following

  Type the following commands to set your Name and Email
    git user.name "Your Name"             -Replace the Your Name in the quotation names with your actual name you want git to know you as
    git user.email "Email@website.com"    -Make this email the same as the email linked to your GitHub profile.

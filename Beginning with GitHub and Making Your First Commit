This is a Tutorial to Learn the GitHub Basics
---------------------------------------------
Instructions

-Follow the numbered instructions step by step to make your first Commit
-Try to type as many of the commands as possible instead of simply copy and pasting, practice makes perfect
-Lines with ** and anything following them are extra credit and you don't need to follow them
 they are meant to teach you some basic terminal commands

---------------------------------------------
1.Create a GitHub Account
  Go to github.com and create your account

---------------------------------------------
2.Install git on your computer:
  Windows/Linux/MacOS go to https://git-scm.com/downloads
    -If link does not work type git into search engine and click on the git-scm.com link and go to downloads
    -Follow the download instructions and get to git installed and the git-bash application as well where you can enter the command line Commands

---------------------------------------------
3.Create a folder/Directory where you can store your git repositories
  -I suggest calling it GitRepos

**Create the folder/directory using Terminal
  Open your systems command prompt/Terminal type the following:
  cd                  -Using this command by itself changes current directory to your default user directory
  pwd                 -Prints the directory you are working in
  ls -l               -Shows you all the items in your current Directory the -l option list them neatly
  mkdir GitRepos      -Makes the GitReops folder/directory in that directory
  ls -l               -Compare this list to the previous one your GitRepos folder/directory should be here now
  cd ./GitRepos       -moves you into the folder/directory you just created
  pwd                 -prints out what directory your in it should have a path and end with /GitRepos

---------------------------------------------
4.Getting the Repository from GitHub
  Now go to your command terminal if not already in it.
    -In terminal navigate to the directory where your Git repositories are going to be stored using the cd command
    -If you followed the extra credit portion above you should already be in that directory

  Type the following into the terminal to get the a repository:
    git clone https://github.com/AMbleu/How-to-Use-GIT.git                -this git clone command is how you download git repositories to edit or simply have a copy

---------------------------------------------
5.Setting up your identity in git to make edits
  When making changes(commits) you need to have a username and email so git knows who made the changes and to tell git who you are do the following

  Type the following commands to set your Name and Email
    git user.name "Your Name"             -Replace the Your Name in the quotation names with the name you want git to know you as
    git user.email "Email@website.com"    -Make this email the same as the email linked to your GitHub profile.

---------------------------------------------
6.Editing a file in the repository
  Navigate to the folder called /GitRepos/How-To-Use-Git in here will be the files you downloaded from GitHub using the clone command.
  Open the file called "GitHub Commit Example" and follow the instructions and place your name in the file save and exit.

**Editing File in Terminal
  In the terminal make sure you are in the /GitRepos/How-To-Use-Git directory in your terminal then type:
  pwd                                 -Print out what directory you are in, make sure your in the /GitRepos/How-To-Use-Git Directory
  ls -l                               -shows what files are in the Directory
  nano 'GitHub Commit Example'        -Opens the terminal text editor, the ' ' are there because the file name contains spaces, write your name in the file
      (Press crtl+x)                  -Press crtl+x to exit the terminal text editor
      (Press y)                       -Press y when it asks if you want to save your changes and it will automatically exit after

---------------------------------------------
7.Adding Files to Staging Area
  Now that the edits have been made to the file "GitHub Commit Example" its time to upload the changes to GitHub.
  To do this you have to add the files to the staging area where they will stay until your ready to upload them to GitHub

  To load the file you type:
    git add 'GitHub Commit Example'                        -moves all files into the Staging Area

---------------------------------------------
8.Committing the changes into GitHub
  Now that you have finalized your changes by adding them to the Staging area it is time to upload them to GitHub

  To upload the files you have to make a commit:
    git commit origin master -m "Edits you made"         -This send the changes you made up to GitHub, inside the " " type a detailed explanation of the edits you made

---------------------------------------------
9.Congratulations That is the end to all the basics
  Now that you have finished all the tutorial, practice what you have just learned by opening the "I Know Git & GitHub" add your name and upload it to Git GOODLUCK!
